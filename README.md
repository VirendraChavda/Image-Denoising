## Installation

To set up and use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/image-denoising.git
   cd image-denoising
   ```
## Features

### Neural Network Training
- Built an autoencoder to denoise images.
- Trained the model with advanced techniques, including:
  - Early stopping.
  - Reduce-on-plateau learning rate adjustment.

---

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing
- Use `Image denoising.ipynb` to:
  - Load and preprocess noisy images.
  - Normalize the data for input into the autoencoder.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- Train the autoencoder using the noisy and clean image pairs.
- Evaluate the performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

## Methodology

### Steps

#### Data Preprocessing
- Created noisy versions of images by adding random noise.
- Normalized image data for input into the neural network.

#### Model Architecture
- Designed an autoencoder with:
  - Convolutional and deconvolutional layers.
  - ReLU activation functions for encoding.
  - Sigmoid activation for decoding.

#### Training
- Used Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and Adam optimizer.
- Implemented early stopping and learning rate adjustment.

#### Evaluation
- Visualized accuracy and loss curves:

## Future Work

### Model Improvements
- Experiment with deeper or more complex autoencoder architectures.
- Add dropout layers to improve generalization.

### Feature Engineering
- Test different noise types (e.g., Gaussian, salt-and-pepper) to improve robustness.

### Deployment
- Deploy the autoencoder as a web or mobile app for real-time image denoising.
